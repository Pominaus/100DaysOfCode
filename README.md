# 100DaysOfCode
### My #100DaysOfCode logbook

**Welcome to my journal for the #100DaysOfCode challenge from Alexander Kallaway! [(repo)](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code "(repo)")**

A great intro to this challenge from its creator can be found [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4), but it's quite simple. Basically I will endevour to:

1. Code for one hour every day.
2. Keep an eperiencial journal (logbook) here on github
3. Share my experiences on github using #100DaysOfCode 
4. Encourage, support and ortherwise be "awseome to each other" with regards all other #100DaysOfCode users on twitter
5. I won't count my studies or any work time towards this challenge.
6. Missing one day is okay, two consequtive days is a fail (I previously failed on day 38 as I was overseas!)
7. share useful resources with others
8. Follow the 100daysofcode twitter bot.

#### How to use:
* Under the logbook directory you should find a logbook for each week of the challenge
* Under the code directory you should find a directory for each week of the challenge
* In those directories, you'll find the daily code snippits. 

_simples!_
