# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Week 1

### Day 15: 6th June, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my first full webpage to go live on the web. I plan to use this site for applying for jobs, and to eventually make it into a wordpress theme.

**Thoughts:** This was very time consuming! I was really happy how I was able to resolve all the problems myself, debug and find solutions to the things that came up. It woud have been a lot easier had I already had a design to be working from rather than organically evolving it as I went, but really I don't know photoshop, so it wouldn't have been any faster. I plan to learn to use image tools in the design are of treehouse.

I really struggled with whether I should be going for a modern, simple design that looks good, but is actually very easy, or a more traditional header and footer site built on floats and positioning to build up the practice of doing it. I also went for total mobile first design and built this for 320px wid screens, testing my design down to chrome's minimum.

### Day 16: 7th June, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I decided to work on my understanding of gradients by playing around with them on codepen. I found some interesting results.

**Thoughts:** This is one of those things I'm so happy I did! I haven't often used gradients, mostly becauseI tend to think ofthem like wordart or other such 90's graphic effects. That means that when I want them, I always have to look up how to do them. That obviously doesn't feel good. As you can see, I started off with just simple linear and radial gradients, but then learnt to build up the layers and see what I could achieve. I pushed it a bit too hard and didn't have time to finish all 9 tiles I had planned, but I'm really happy with my progress and the thing's I have found from this. I  think I'd like to return to this at some point.
