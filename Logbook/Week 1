# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Week 1

### Day 1: 22nd May, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt some git bash commands to become more comfortable with git version control and not just github.

**Thoughts:** This was important to me as the first time I attempted this challenge I didn't really know git, and just figured out how to use github. Instead I focused on keeping a blog, that really was too big a commitment to keep up daily. I was worrying about screenshots and SRO and maintaining my blog all just to post today's progress. When I started to get behind on my posts, it added to the pressure. This time around I want to learn from the mistakes made before and track my progress here and just focus on the code. I will instead use my blog for a "things I learnt this week" summary, rather than a daily post. 

With that in mind, to kick off this challenge, I thought I'd start by getting to know git a little better. This is day 1 of 2 I intend to spend on git, and today I was only dealing with local repo's. I got quite comfotable with the working directory, staging area and the repository, as well as a deeper understanding of merging branches, .gitignore, and recovering mistakes in the working directory from the staging area.

### Day 2: 23 May, 2017

**Today's Progress**: This was the seond of the two days I asigned for git. Today I learned some more advanced git commands such as stash, tag, reset, etc as well as conneting my local repo to github.

**Thoughts:** Today was interesting as the material I was following was treating the Github side of things as more advanced,but from using the website, some of the more advanced areas like branching, cloning, commenting, "time traveling" through history, etc. But at the same time, learning how to do this from git bash helped me to understand things in a deeper level. All in all I feel ready to move on from studying git and just start using it day to day from my computer and learn on the job as it were. There's still a few times I've gotten lost when my local and remote branches have gotten out of sync and I didn't notice it, but I think I'm now working out how to spot the error and where to go.
