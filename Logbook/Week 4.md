# 100 Days of Code - Log For Week 4


### Day 20: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Not a lot to be honest. I went back to my weather app and wanted to add in some google maps features. What I did was break everything. 

**Thoughts:** This was a toughie! I've not used jQuery in a while and I made some really simple mistakes. It took me over an hour to get out of the bugs I'd put into my code. The positive result was that I'm now feeling quite refreshed with jQuery, but it's highlighted the importance of keeping up with everything. There's a jQuery section coming up on my treehouse track in a few days - I need to really practice that content when I get there.

### Day 21: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today was one of my "study whatever I like days". I wanted to study some python, but I haven't used it in a while, so wasn't confident, and not sure what to do. I decided to check out the treehouse forums and find a question that would make a good challenge

**Thoughts:** This was a lot of fun! I found a couple of questions and really got to practice some advanced stuff! The main project was swapping keys and values in a dictionary. I had to identify potential problems - like mutable values, how the dictionary is formated, how external API's might change, etc. 

I learned about the .__hash__ method, the zip() function, dictionary comprehension and filter methods (previous question). It really helped keep my python fresh, and I'm becomming constantly more confident in python 3, not always thinking in python2.
