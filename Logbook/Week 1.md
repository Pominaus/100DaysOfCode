# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Week 1

### Day 1: 22nd May, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt some git bash commands to become more comfortable with git version control and not just github.

**Thoughts:** This was important to me as the first time I attempted this challenge I didn't really know git, and just figured out how to use github. Instead I focused on keeping a blog, that really was too big a commitment to keep up daily. I was worrying about screenshots and SRO and maintaining my blog all just to post today's progress. When I started to get behind on my posts, it added to the pressure. This time around I want to learn from the mistakes made before and track my progress here and just focus on the code. I will instead use my blog for a "things I learnt this week" summary, rather than a daily post. 

With that in mind, to kick off this challenge, I thought I'd start by getting to know git a little better. This is day 1 of 2 I intend to spend on git, and today I was only dealing with local repo's. I got quite comfotable with the working directory, staging area and the repository, as well as a deeper understanding of merging branches, .gitignore, and recovering mistakes in the working directory from the staging area.

### Day 2: 23 May, 2017

**Today's Progress:** This was the seond of the two days I asigned for git. Today I learned some more advanced git commands such as stash, tag, reset, etc as well as conneting my local repo to github.

**Thoughts:** Today was interesting as the material I was following was treating the Github side of things as more advanced,but from using the website, some of the more advanced areas like branching, cloning, commenting, "time traveling" through history, etc. But at the same time, learning how to do this from git bash helped me to understand things in a deeper level. All in all I feel ready to move on from studying git and just start using it day to day from my computer and learn on the job as it were. There's still a few times I've gotten lost when my local and remote branches have gotten out of sync and I didn't notice it, but I think I'm now working out how to spot the error and where to go.

### Day 3: 24 May, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Whoo what a day! Having been away on honeymoon for a month, and busy the month previous, this was my first day back into web development. I spent most of the day just studying on freecode camp to catch back up and stave off the dreaded knowledge loss. I only just managed to squeeze in a little CSS on codepen.io for about 1hhr 15 before running out of time.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing the difference that even a small period of inactivity can lead to! After spending 2 days learning new things with git, today was back to revising that which I should know and exposing knowledge gaps. Weirdly I was more comfortable with a lot fo the more challenging stuff than the easier, and I think that's because I'd studied it more recently. Today has really reminded me how important it is to keep up with the coding. As one of my favourite instructors suggests: FOCUS: Follow One Course Until Succesful

### Day 4: 25 May, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I was a little limited for time, and knew I wouldn't have time to do what I'd planned on my web development track, so instead I went back to my hobby of Unity game development and did some eperiments with reflections andthe state machine.

**Thoughts:** It's been a little while since I've had a play in Unity what with focusing on my webdevelopment goals, so it was nice to just spend a couple of hours playing around again, and really interesting to see how things I've learnt as a web developer actually came to help my insite into Unity engine's functionality.

**Link to work:** Sadly as this was all inside the unity editor today, it's all just config files, so no upload today. When I get around to adding a repo for my unity projects, I'll add a README in for today's work.

### Day 5: 26 May 2017:

**Today's Progress:** Today I got back on track with javascript. I watch a couple of hours of videos on pluralsight and then went back over to freecodecamp's website to test myself on some algorithms for an hour.

**Thoughts:** The stuff covered on Pluralsight was really interesting and indepth. The freecodecamp algorithms were the beginner ones so a bit easier, but it was really good to have a go and refresh myself on them, feel like I'm making progress.

### Day 6: 27 May 2017:

**Today's Progress:** Today I started off by spending an hour of so just playing aroung with regex expressions to become more familiar, then did a few algorithm challenges from freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** The RegEx was hard! This is something I've done before, but it really hadn't stuck in my memory, and so took about 20 minutes to make sense of again, and then I precticed it some more. Most of th e algorithms were quite easy, but again I got stuck for a little while on the regex one, which is why I did the extra study. All in all it was good to recap this stuff to get it to feel more natural.
