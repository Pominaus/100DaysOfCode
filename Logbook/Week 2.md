# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Week 1

### Day 8: 29nd May, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Comleted the Ceasar cipher challenge on free code camp, studied API requests in javascript and jquery, then implimented the geolaction and weater data fetch for my weather app.

**Thoughts:** Today was hard, but fun. I'm comfortable with objects and JSON, but API's were a new area, and I rean into several unexpected headaches not in the course or API creator's documentation that were a real challenge. I've done quite a few programming courses now, but I feel this is the point where I'm really starting to move into more advanced and useful areas, and that's very exciting.

The real take away from today has been to avoid template matching! I have a very strong skillset in trouble shooting and isolating problems from my time as a device technician, but today, because the course challenge brief said that the API would work with the hosting platform, I assumed for over an hour the problem was in my code, rather than approach it clinically and read the browser's error logs, not just the host's.

### Day 9: 30th May, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I started the C# track on pluralsight using the three month free trial. I also tried the Visual Studio Code editor on Linux (SUSE). For my hour of code, I just experimented with and extended the course example, focusing on my object structure.

**Thoughts:** Bit of a weird one really. I've only done the absolute basics of C# before, and this course comes in hitting very high, very fast, so I actually learnt quite a lot. It was also my first time really using Visual Studio for any period of time. There were definitely times I felt a bit out of my depth, but just such a great amount of learning today. I've only just started this course, but really amazing how much I've learnt! I look forward to the next C# day on Thursday!

### Day 10: 31st May 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I set myself the side challenge of making a teromino block game in html/css/js. To be honest I didnt get too far.

**Thoughts:** Phew! what a challengeing day! I decided to really go with a mobile-first approach for the first time. actually on my way to the library to study I found a $19 android phone in the supermarket by chance and bought it just so i could check my work on a low end android browser as well as safari. 

after spending about 1.5 hours on my layout and checking different screen widths, heights and ratios, I realised there had to be a better way than how i was making my liquid layout. i'd reas about flex and decided to give it a go. I read MDN's info a few times and watched a couple of examples on youtube. i then spent 2 hours convering my layout to use flex, and i encountered my first browser conflict (iOS safari cant handle a whole range of width parameters with flex aparently, but that lead me to find out more about flex-basic.

All in all a great day of learning, even if i didnt actually get thst far with the 'game' side of things!
