# 100 Days Of Code - Log for Week 1

### Day 8: 29nd May, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Comleted the Ceasar cipher challenge on free code camp, studied API requests in javascript and jquery, then implimented the geolaction and weater data fetch for my weather app.

**Thoughts:** Today was hard, but fun. I'm comfortable with objects and JSON, but API's were a new area, and I rean into several unexpected headaches not in the course or API creator's documentation that were a real challenge. I've done quite a few programming courses now, but I feel this is the point where I'm really starting to move into more advanced and useful areas, and that's very exciting.

The real take away from today has been to avoid template matching! I have a very strong skillset in trouble shooting and isolating problems from my time as a device technician, but today, because the course challenge brief said that the API would work with the hosting platform, I assumed for over an hour the problem was in my code, rather than approach it clinically and read the browser's error logs, not just the host's.

### Day 9: 30th May, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I started the C# track on pluralsight using the three month free trial. I also tried the Visual Studio Code editor on Linux (SUSE). For my hour of code, I just experimented with and extended the course example, focusing on my object structure.

**Thoughts:** Bit of a weird one really. I've only done the absolute basics of C# before, and this course comes in hitting very high, very fast, so I actually learnt quite a lot. It was also my first time really using Visual Studio for any period of time. There were definitely times I felt a bit out of my depth, but just such a great amount of learning today. I've only just started this course, but really amazing how much I've learnt! I look forward to the next C# day on Thursday!
