## Day 8

Today I started the C# course on plural sight. As my whole day was following the course, at the end I spent my hour extending the project. Here are the 3 C# files. They are unlinked here without the rest of the VS solution as this is just for code review.

To see the Projects, please see my pluralsight course repo.
