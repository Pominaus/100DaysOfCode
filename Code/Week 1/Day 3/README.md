## Day 3

Today's code is just copied over from [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/Pominaus/pen/ybZPYQ). These files aren'y linked for that reason. The idea was to make the social buttons merge out from the profile pic when it's hovered over, but after a solid day of studying one of my online JS courses, I struggled to squeeze in an hour for this and ran out of time before getting a chance to trial CSS annimations vs jquery/JS. I'll return to this as I'm excited about the effect.
