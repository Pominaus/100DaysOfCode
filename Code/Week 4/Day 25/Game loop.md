The sticky note I used to plan game loop

>click:
>>Decide if it's first or second item selected
>>>If first, store value and reveal card
>>>>evaluate card for life & death
>>>>>If life, add one to life, add 20 to score
>>>>>>if death, minus one from life
>>>>>>>if life = 0, end game, announce loose
>>>>>>>>show score
>>>if second, repeat 3-7
>>>>compare two cards
>>>>>if cards match, increase score by 10
>>>>>>Check if game complete
>>>>>>>if game complete, anounce win
>>>>>>>>show score
>>>>>>wait for interaction
>>>>>if cards don't match, reset pair
